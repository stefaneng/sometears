## Introduction

We implemented an R package that reproduces the TOPO (linear) algorithm [@deng2023] as well as the DAGMA (linear) algorithm [@bello2023] in R.
These algorithm provides an innovative solution to the non-convex optimization problems associated with learning the structure of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
The project is named after the original continuous acyclicity function NOTEARS [@zheng2018].

## Background

## Algorithm

## Evaluation

## Contributions

Jacob and Ye independently implemented an initial version of the TOPO algorithm which we combined into a single version as well as running the python version on the Sachs dataset.
Stefan implemented the DAGMA algorithms, the linear SEM evaluation and wrote the R package, the documentation and miscellaneous functions.
